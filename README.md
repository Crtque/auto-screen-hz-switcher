# Laptop Power Screen Optimizer

Laptop Power Screen Optimizer automatically adjusts your screen’s refresh rate based on your laptop’s power source.  
It switches to a **high refresh rate when plugged in** and **lowers it on battery** to extend battery life.  
Includes easy setup scripts, Task Scheduler integration, and optional autostart.
